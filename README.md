# UCFMGlobber
## **U**NIX **C**urse **F**orge **M**odpack **Globber** 

### Purpose
UCFMGlobber is a program written in python to:
  - parse modpack manifest from curseforge
  - use an API key (user provided) to get the mods required
  - fetch all mods in the modpac manifest json
  - compile all the mods into a single folder, ready to play

### Problem 
The problem that UCFMGlobber solves is one that I face personally. I am a linux user who plays a ton of modded minecraft. When I want to playa modpack, I cannot use curseforge, so I must resort to downloading each file manually. The UCFMGlobber does away with all of that and allows the user to request the download and compilation of any minecraft modpack on curseforge they can install.

### Solution
Make a program to get all the mods and place them elegantly in a folder, ready to be compiled by Forge or Fabric.

### Functions To Expect
- getting a list of minecraft modpacks
- searching for a modpack
- GUI
- compiling the mods downloaded
- update modpacks

### Features NOT To Expect
- forge or fabric installer
- modpack versioner
- have uses for games outside of MINECRAFT
